  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using all of the skills that have lead up to being over 50 percent of the way through the learning Python course which have been vital to completing a multitude of tasks along the way of the course, such as how to define (or def) functions or how to create variables and turn them into lists that will do further things with other skills in syntax along the way. The strategy of looking back at the most relevant other tasks to this task is very effective as it gives me worked examples of similar things and the same syntax.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the speed at which it took me to find the menu on the codecademy website which could take me to any of the other learn python tasks in the course that I would need to to improve my learning, syntax and speed at writing out code that does what I want. I need to work on the habit of filling in the homework and progress sheet on google classroom as for the past two or three weeks I hadn't been doing that so therefore had to look over my code to remember what I had done.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I shall have three separate tabs open for me to be able to get on with the work and do it more efficiently, firstly I will have the obvious two tabs of codecademy and the progress sheet, but then, on top of those two, I will have the section on codecademy that lets me look back on previous tasks so I can easily go back for some more help if I wish. This will improve my learning by increasing the accessibility of the knowledge that I need to complete the task before me and giving me all the work that I have done to remind me of the skills I have gained so far on the course. </td>
