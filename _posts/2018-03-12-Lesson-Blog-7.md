  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying many different options and messing around with the wires, and, because of some technical difficulties, writing out the appropriate code over, and over again. It seems that me and my partner Jaiman (and also Rex for this lesson) have fully mastered the art of wiring what the book describes, this relies on the strategy of trying different possibilities and patterns and the strategy of learning what code relates to what spot on the breadboard itself. This will  help us on future stages, such as the mechanical arm which we can get a headstart on connecting to the breadboard, with our knowledge of the breadboard.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The glitch that many of our breadboards had which made us unable to run our programs and even save our work limited our learning immensely, this both meant that I had to write out the same code over and over again on several different fuse boxes but that my partners had to keep wiring up the same pattern over and over again. We do need to work on the habit of thinking of new ways to fix things if this problem ever arises again, because even with the amount of effort and thought that went into the process we used for problem solving, we didn't think of enough to actually sort the problem.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change, first of all, our fuse box, or, just keep thinking of how to stop the error happening on the editor. I will also improve my learning by doing this, being able to get a lot more work done with the skills we have acquired over the last few weeks, vastly increasing our work per lesson ratio (hopefully to the speed we got to in the first few lessons- maybe even faster) and learning a lot more as a whole. Also I will improve my learning by using my knowledge to help my peers overcome these challenges- as I have already done today, helping luke do the code our fuse box couldn't perform and making it work perfectly well, and also helping a few other people out with quick tasks (this was all whilst our machine wouldnâ€™t act on the code that I had put into it).</td>
