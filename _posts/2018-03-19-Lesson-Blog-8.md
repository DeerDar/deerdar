    <td>I learnt by reading the instructions carefully and precisely typing out the correct code to achieve the things I want to achieve, the strategy of partnering up my fast typing/coding skills with Jaiman's amazing ability to wire the FUSE board incredibly quickly- this let us get a heap of work done during the lesson, as apparent with the four videos I made showing our progress. I also learnt by remembering what all the different code does to my wiring board, using this to predict what happens to the screen according to the text i had written in.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on how I film videos for this blog, learning from the four videos I have made today, working on the habit of talking over what the code is performing and properly explaining what is going on according to the code. You can see examples of the progress that I have made in the four videos below this blog. The first two don't really need any commentary, but the light dependent resistor was dependant on explanation, as the fizzing numbers and expanding dot where all people had to go on.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try to change my typing speed to become even faster, starting with this blog post and continuing throughout my IT work, getting things done faster and therefore learning quicker. I will improve my learning by thinking more about each phrase as I type it, like the coding phrase, pinmode, which I have learnt to correspond with turning on an LED and the exact place the LED is put in. I will also try to think harder about the content I write into these sections of my blog in class, so I can actually write about the struggles I faced in lessons and not what I should do to improve out of lesson, although this is still important too.</td>
