  <tr>
    <td>I furthered my knowledge by trying out some various hour of code, coding challenges, such as  minecraft creator, debugger and codecombat. I believe trying and perseverance were both brilliant strategies for code, because sometimes it goes wrong, but you have to keep going and trying it in a different way. </td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Some coding challenges, such as Debugger, glitched so I couldn't go on to one of the infrequent actual spurts of coding-luckily I realised this coding practice wasnâ€™t challenging my coding knowledge, it was just a game! So I moved onto something that actually helped my learning!</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will try not to go with the crowd, to do what everyone else is doing, because sometimes, like in this case (Debugger), they aren't doing what will expand their learning so that they can get better, they might just be messing around. </td>
