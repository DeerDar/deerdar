(add details to "Lesson Review")</th>
    <td> Yes, I did use and wire the fuse box, although I was in a guitar lesson for most of the lesson.</td>

    <td>I learnt by, after being in my overrun music lesson, asking my group members (as said before Jaiman Lad, and in this lesson and maybe future lessons, Rex Vidal) what we went through in the book this lesson; this strategy along with helping them wire the cables, trying every different pattern, drawing of what I have learnt in other subjects, such as science where we did circuits and wired them up like this, using my own knowledge, were very effective. Despite having a music lesson that went on for forty five minutes during this lesson, I did actually get a lot of work done with my partner and new found group member.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Obviously the massive hole in my lesson that was Guitar is the major factor that limited my learning as this meant I only had Â¼ (a quarter) of the time everyone else had to learn more code. The habit that I need to work on is what I am doing now which is catching up with the work that my group did that I missed whilst strumming on my strings, I will look through all of the code that they put together in the time I was busy and try to work out what all of it does, familiarising myself with the coding terms that I was unable to read about in the lesson, but that were used in context in the folders on my USB stick.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will try to remember the new storeroom for my instrument as this will allow me to put it away and get back to my learning faster as I fear that more music lessons will land on this time of Period 3, IT as I have a lot of Monday lessons this half term (according to the ever changing timetable). Me, as described before, going through the pieces of code I missed out on reading  or typing out this lesson will improve my learning drastically from the fifteen minutes of IT I have done in class today, I will always do this aforementioned tasks after lessons I may miss, some or all of, in the future.</td>
