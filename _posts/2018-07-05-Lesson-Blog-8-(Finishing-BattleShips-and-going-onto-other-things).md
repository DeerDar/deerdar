  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by looking back over my other tasks, especially the tasks in battleships as these include the largest variety of syntax and skill usage so If I needed to try to remember a skill it would probably be in there somewhere, and trying to find the appropriate syntax that I could utilities during newer tasks in chapter 8. The strategy which I talked about in an earlier blog post about looking over the different tasks on a different tab really helped me with this task b giving me easy access to all of my past code, this was useful.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by the fact that in some tasks I was unable to correctly integer and space out my code so bits of code where in the right place, however after a lot of fiddling about with the code and the space bar I was finally able to indent these lines of text properly, so the habit I need to work on from this experience is the habit of checking the indentation level for each line of code so it makes sense with the things which I am trying to do. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will change how I go about writing my code, as I have begun to notice that I am not reading the task example as much as I need to, doing this has meant that my speed and ability to do the specific task at hand has gone down, so I think that to improve my learning I need to read all of the information given to me about the task so that I have all of the knowledge necessary to complete the task to its fullest.</td>
