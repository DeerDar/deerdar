  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by drawing on all of the skill I have learnt over the course of this term and using them to help with me understanding the code that I had been typing over the course of the lesson today. The strategy of, again, me typing out the code and Jaiman wiring up the breadboard really worked, this combines my fast, exact typing with jaimans ability to wire things quickly to improve our speed and increase our work output. In Fact you can see proof of all of this work below (3 videos) and in the last Lesson Blog (4 videos). As well as this we finished the booklet, even getting to the special stage 1-1, the robot arm- and coding this.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The fact that this lesson is the last chance to learn theses skills has limited my learning to this turn, but I can work on the habits I have learnt during this term over the course of the time when I need to utilize my coding ability in the future. I also need to work on the habit- for all subjects- of asking for help, as we all need some help otherwise. On top of that I need to work on the habit of thinking up what to say over the recording of my code working, I need to think of appropriate things to say that will fully explain in detail what is going on with my fuze box, and maybe link all of it back to my code more.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change my whole outlook on coding for the next time I ever participate in it. Drawing all that I have learnt and altogether improving my knowledge on how to write code itself. I will also improve my learning by drawing on some of the different improvement points I have picked up on in these posts in the past term, thinking more about my typing speed (which has increased dramatically since the beginning of the IT this year!), my ability to recall things that happened that day- my memory and my ability to ask others for help when I am in need of some, thinking about how to combat my shyness.</td>
