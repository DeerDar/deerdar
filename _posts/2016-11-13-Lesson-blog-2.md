    <td>I learned by looking over my blog, seeing my mark (3/9) and comparing it with the mark scheme then thinking about how I could improve my blog in ways such as:
Adding a background (after I had trouble with my code it was deleted), improving the content of my posts (this is what I am trying to do now) and adding tables, which I shall try after I have posted this lesson review.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The mistake that I made at the beginning limited my learning because the background image made the text (which was a similar colour to the background in question) illegible. I need to work on my background so I have one that doesn't make the text 'invisible' and maybe change the colour of the text itself.  </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by checking the colour of a background before I submit it to my blog to check if it is a similar colour to the text. I will also change my blog so the posts like these have tables around them so that they can be read more easily by the ‘viewer’ and I might change the colour of the text.</td>
