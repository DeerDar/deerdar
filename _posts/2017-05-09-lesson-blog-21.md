    <th>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by discussing in my groups, especially during the positive social media rules task. I also learnt by hearing other groups ideas after we had all completed this task. I think the strategy of listening to your group's ideas and expanding on them is a very effective strategy.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My group kind of limited my learning as they didn't put forward many ideas and after a couple of minutes some members went on to talk about other things to other people, not doing the task at hand. I was also unable to think of many ideas during the thinking activity, I didnâ€™t have many ideas.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to think of more ideas and try to persuade members of my team not to go have their own private chat, with someone not in our group, or to not talk about the things we have been asked to talk about.</td>
