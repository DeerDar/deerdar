  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying lots of different phrases which I have learnt throughout the exercises so far to solve the specific problem I faced at the time, although this sometimes doesn't work when the problem I am having is the first time it has shown up in the course. Another great strategy that I found effective has been reading  the hints section if I ever get into a corner or an unable to decode the problem from the error message. Another great strategy for learning python using this course that I have found recently is that I can do a bit of work on it every day, spreading out the workload, doing more work and learning more more frequently in the process.</td>

    <td>The amount of tasks in each section through me off this time around, as there were two separate sections to part 2 and 3, so when I had finished the first section of these two parts I got a bit confused and thought I'd gotten further than I actually did. I need to work on the habit of being able to complete codecademy as fast at home as I do in my IT lessons, as I have noticed that I make a lot more progress whilst in school than I am doing for homework- not getting through as many stages as I could if I put more time into it than 30 minutes, so I think I should start spending longer on codecademy in the future.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will change how I go about working on codecademy for homework, doing about 30 minutes every night for a week, from monday to monday, so that more overall a lot more than before can be gotten done, increasing my progress through all of the stages and increasing my learning by letting me learn more python syntax and logic, over a longer space of time. This will overtime also improve my learning by making me faster at the tasks so I can do a lot more of this learning in a shorter space of time after using this method for a while.</td>
