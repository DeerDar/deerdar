  <tr>
    <td>I learnt how to use a lot of syntax which I have previously learned across the weeks in one group as the coding tasks have begun to make me write out huge blocks of very complex code and bringing together in one lesson to make my own full set of code that does what I want and completes its own complex tasks. The strategy of reading literally everything that is given to me in way of hints and examples usually gives me enough of the clues which I need to piece together some good code that will achieve the task given to me during the briefing.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The amount of syntax which I have to remember in order to complete even one task at this point of 'chapter six' is incredible, but often slows down my work and work speed as I have to make the odd check back down my work or google search on my home computer in order to find out how to complete the order that I have been instructed to do. I need to work on the habit of my memory and improving and expanding my knowledge of the syntax necessary to go further in this project and complete the course.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to remember more of the syntax which I have already gone over so that I can easily create large paragraphs of code using this import and basic syntax to help structure my good code. I will improve my learning by doing more codecademy and continuously looking over the older tasks where the python course went over the most important or ones that I have forgotten syntax so that I can remember who to use the specific code that is relevant to me.</td>
