    <td>I learnt that to save a project on  a FUSE BOX, you have to have had the USB stick inside the machine as you have been working on your coding. I persevered with the coding though, and in that field I kept trying until the code (and evidently what i want to happen with the code) worked. Although I have had some experience in this sort of coding before, I have coded games onto my dad's SINCLAIR XZ81 and in the national computing museum programmed one of the early computers- it had a hard drive that was 2m in length that held 8 bytes of storage, so I had a headstart on Jaiman Lad- my Partner.</td>

    <td>The not plugging in the USB stick before i coded using Fuze was the main problem i was faced with today. I tried to tackle this but unfortunately all me and Jaiman were left with was a USB drive with a few empty Fuze projects on them and a knowledge of what we will do next time to further our learning. I need to work on my ideas of a fuze box and how to work with them and a USB stick storing all of the information. Also, on the Blog side of the equation I need to work on my ability to work out what piece of code makes what thing happen on the blog, which I was working on throughout my recreating blog experience.</td>

    <td>Next time I will put both Jaiman and I’s USB sticks into the FUSE BOX before we start to work on any of our code, as this will mean we will not make a repeat of the mistake we made today by not doing the above and losing the WHOLE of section 1- Hello World and almost ALL of section 2- Variables… eh. As this will impact our learning if we can check over all of the earlier code we have done to help us learn from our mistakes and put everything we can do well into our current pieces of code. I will also try to get setup as quickly as possible next lesson as in this lesson Jaiman and I’s Computer didn’t work for a while at the start so that slowed us down from doing more work and therefore learning more.</td>
