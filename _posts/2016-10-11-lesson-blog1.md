  <tr>
    <td>I learned by taking notes whilst Mr. Keen was showing us the code that should be used when adding a table to posts such as this one. I was then able to refer to this if was stuck or the code didn't work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will look at all of the code when trying to solve a problem, such as adding a background to my blog, for code that is 'disagreeingâ€™ with the code that is changing the background of my blog. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will check the whole code for problems when it looks as though there is nothing wrong with the code that seems to be going wrong. </td>
