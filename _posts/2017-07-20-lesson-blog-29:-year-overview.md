    <td>Overall I think IT has gone well this year, I think that I have tried my hardest at everything that I have had to do. Although I did find it hard to persevere during the coding of this very blog and while I was creating my own game on scratch, I kept on going until I had got it right. I have also been trying to keep up the level of righting of this blog throughout the year, writing at least three lines of text in every box and always writing them the night after the lesson except for a couple of occasions where I couldn't have. So in conclusion I have tried my hardest all year, persevered with things that were difficult and continued to keep this blog throughout. 
I will see you next year.
Oscar.</td>
