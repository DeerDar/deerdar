    <td>I learned by taking notes when Mr keen was  telling us how to do different things, such as scrolling or the start menu. This strategy is very effective as I have now got some written help for when i'm starting to build my game. Although, I may have some problems remembering exactly what the code should be when I go back to it, my notes can be a bit vague. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My understanding of the dynamics of scratch very much limited my learning today. I need to work on my knowledge of how scratch works, such as scrolling and what is actually happening when I use that code. As in how the character can move the different sprites to create the moving backdrop .</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will get my notebook out when doing the things that I do at the start of the lesson and I will try and understand what is meant by all of the special coding words or how I can make something happen. I will try to always understand what Mr. keen is saying when explaining things to us.</td>
