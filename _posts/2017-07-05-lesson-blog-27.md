  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by honing my skills on PREZI and by researching about internet safety and how to secure your files and data- not getting caught out by malware (phishing, adware, spyware, trojans, viruses and worms) and about conduct on the internet. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I found it difficult to manipulate text boxes into the shape of the container I was using. This meant it took me a long time to layout what I wanted to say, I also found it difficult to move and change around different symbols ( such as arrows or lines) to point at the writing that I wanted people to focus on.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will practice this as I continue to use PREZI by trying to move them through all of the options on the top of the screen. I will also work on making my text into bullet points so the people I am presenting to can focus on one of my speaking points at a time.</td>
