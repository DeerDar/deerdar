  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying a lot of different patterns with the wiring, looking very hard at the picture to try and copy the connections made with the wire on their demo Fuze Box. The Strategy that I found effective was trying every different way of doing things, every combination and using our sheer determination to get over it, even if we didn't. I also renamed all of the files on my USB drive to the project numbers so that I can find them more easily, this made my work more organised so that if, in the future, I need to look back on the code i've done, I can see it at different points and code lines that I have come across throughout my time with the Fuze box.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The inability for the wiring and code for the wiring to work in unison, this made it so that I couldn’t progress with the book or see the hard work that I put into the wiring pay off with a flashing light. I need to work on (or do) asking a teacher for help with the task at hand, I needed to ask for help, either with replacing the bulb, fixing the wiring or writing the code properly, everyone needs some help sometimes. I also need to work on my speed at getting the Fuse box and peripherals at the begging of the lesson as each time we begin, Jaiman is able to go out and get our box quicker, I end up just getting the peripherals ready, I just want to be helpful.</td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the amount of USB sticks that I have on me next time as this time I had two on me- one containing all of the IT work I have done this year, and another that I grabbed in a panic this morning as I thought I’d lost my USB, which had some of my lecturing stuff on it, luckily his work is safely at home now, but I had to check in class which one that I could put my work onto safely, wasting my time and therefore affecting my learning. I will improve my learning by thinking more about the breadboard before the next lesson, where I need to place the cables and how the code syncs up to all of this.</td>
