  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by utilising the skills which I have learnt doing this course to try and work round the problems which I faced, I also was able to utilise my common sense whilst scanning over the entirety of one piece of code to find any errors and solve more problems from there. The strategy of looking over every bit of code was super effective, but however I was only able to utilise this means of fixing problems at the last couple of minutes of the lesson as I was clueless to what was wrong for most of it.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by my inability to see what was wrong with the task, I have looked at it after the lesson and come to the conclusion that a line of text was outside a definition instead of inside it and the code worked perfectly, so from this I have learnt that you should read all tasks on codecademy very literally and take every word as it should be, because if you get confused with where things have to go it could be the only thing holding you back from completing more for the entire lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will change how I read the tasks at hand and, as I have said in the last section of the post, take it all as literally as I can to avoid any confusion over where to place things next time. I will improve my learning this way and therefore be able to get a lot more done with all of my skill and syntax knowledge which went to waste this lesson. Another factor which shall improve my learning is honing my skills through practicing other tasks which I have already done again, going over them and trying to remember all of the syntax at the same time as how to use it in other circumstances.
