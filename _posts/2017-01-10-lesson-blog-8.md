    <td>I learnt by listening to what i had to do while Mr. Keen went through the whole template for our scratch projects, going over all of the stages. We also went over our Uberblogs and learnt what we could have done better, this will help for next time when we are starting our scratch projects. </td>

    <td>I can't think of what to do for my project, I need to work on thinking of original and simple ideas that I could complete in the time limit that we have for our projects.
