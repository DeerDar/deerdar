  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying different combinations on lightbot and the strategy that was the most effective for me was visualising witch way the robot should look so he can move in the right direction towards the lights. I have put my 'hour of code' certificate at the bottom of this blog post. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was very limited during the homework because to complete level 3 I had to complete both levels 1 and 2, my work wasnâ€™t saved from the lesson so I had to begin again. Luckily I completed 1 and 2 very quickly and got straight to level 3. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will work on my problem solving skills as I was quite slow on lots of the puzzles and found them quite difficult. I will also work on not being distracted by other people completing levels, or other work, as I may be struggling with the same piece of work they have completed.</td>
