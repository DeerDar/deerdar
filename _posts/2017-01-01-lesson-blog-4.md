  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by listening to all of Mr. Keen's Ideas about how we could try to post blogs and outsmart the 404 error message. I found that taking mental notes and looking back on them whilst trying things out really works.</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The 404 error message really limited my learning as I couldn’t post blogs in the first place. Another problem was the speed I was working at because I didn’t even get to see if the suggestion Mr. Keen made worked (I later found out that unfortunately it didn’t).</td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will practice writing these blogs faster so I can get them done quickly and I will just save these blogs on google drive instead of posting them in the time being. </td>
