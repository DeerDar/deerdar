    <td>I learnt by remembering all of the different syntax which I have been learning across the course of the pythons lessons, and using these to learn even more of the vital syntax that I will need to know to progress through the course, such as the list editing commands, del, .append and .sort. The strategy of using this other syntax in conjunction with the new syntax that I am practicing really binds the new syntax into what I already know. I learnt a lot of useful pieces of syntax in today's lesson and for homework.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The speed at which I am working now greatly limits the amount of learning and sections that I can do in one time, however this is probably bound to happen due to the increasing difficulty of the tasks and the increasing length and how much you have to do in the tasks, so they are getting longer on their own. I need to work on the habit of remembering more of the syntax which I have learnt recently as knowing these will help me to improve both the speed of my work and the quality of my work.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change how much of the syntax which I know off by heart there is as this will greatly improve my learning by speeding me up and, as I have said before in this very blog post, the quality of my answers to the tasks. I will also change my approach to each question, by, instead of going straight for the task, going for the description of the code that I will need to utilise to do well in the task itself, this will improve my answers and take away any confusion from the solving of the problem.</td>
