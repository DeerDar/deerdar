  <tr>
    <td>Asteroides</td>
    <td>Lives, points, speed of asteroides. </td>
    <td>The asteroids themselves (small, medium and large), enemy ships, the 'bullets'.</td>
    <td>The enemy ships only come in after a certain time and they shoot in random directions, move in random directions and can be killed by the asteroides too. The asteroides break into 2 smaller asteroids they do this 3 times.</td>
    <td>Your spaceship can only propel itself forward whilst you turn and fire, you have a delay every 5 shots and you stay on the same difficulty throughout your 3 lives.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Arkanoid</td>
    <td>Points, lives</td>
    <td>The "vaus" spacecraft, the ball, the bricks, the power-ups, the writing (at the beginning). </td>
    <td>The cut sequence at the start has been made well and there are a variety of power ups that can be used to do different things. Such as gain lives which cannot be done in many other games. </td>
    <td>The silver bricks have 2 lives as you have to hit them twice, you only start with one life unlike many other arcade games.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Frogger</td>
    <td>Points, lives, time</td>
    <td>The frogs, the cars, the logs, the flies, the turtles and the time bar.</td>
    <td>You can move in all four directions which helps when you reach the pond. The cars start slower at the beginning of the game.</td>
    <td>You have a time limit which added to the difficulty makes the game even harder. When you move you take a step and then there is a pause before you continue moving. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Donkey kong</td>
    <td>Points, how far up you have gotten (this game and in the past), lives.</td>
    <td>Mario, Donkey kong, barrels, fire, peach, ladders, bars.</td>
    <td>The barrels are challenging to jump over and go in random directions so there are no patterns that you could memories. </td>
    <td>You sometimes gain points when you hit the barrel and sometimes when you die you fall down and float in the sky. You go very slow.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Space Invaders</td>
    <td>Points, lives.</td>
    <td>Your ship, all the invaders, walls, the “bullets”.</td>
    <td>The invaders slowly come down which makes the game challenging. The invaders shoot at random places which means they don’t target you.   </td>
    <td>The walls can be broken by your bullets as well as the invaders bullets, this can often sabotage yourself. Sometimes the invaders shoot after or during them dieing. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chuckie egg </td>
    <td>Points, lives, seconds.</td>
    <td>You, the birds, the eggs, the bird seed, the walls, the ladders.</td>
    <td>The birds move in patterns and don’t target you, you get 4 lives, unlike the usual 3, you continue haven collected what you did if you lose a life.</td>
    <td>Sometimes you can’t get up the ladders and the birds can climb ladders.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pac-man</td>
    <td>lives , points, speed of ghosts.</td>
    <td>pac-man , ghosts, power pills, berries.</td>
    <td>You can go through one side of the field and come out the other. The power pills work fine, unlike in my game. You have the normal 3 life format.</td>
    <td>You are always moving so you have to push the controls quite frantically to keep away from the ghosts. The power pill only works for a short period of time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Pong</td>
    <td>Your points, opponents points.</td>
    <td>Paddle, ball.</td>
    <td>The ball doesn't react to the ‘scoreboard’. The ball bounces of all sides except behind your paddle. </td>
    <td>The ball is very fast and added to the fact that the racket is very slow it causes problems. The net has nothing to do with the game, they could have made it so that the ball has to go over it. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Q*bert</td>
    <td>Points, the level, the round.</td>
    <td>Q*bert, the blocks, the balls that attack you.</td>
    <td>The blocks light up as you step on them, it has the normal 3 life system. You know which way the ball is going to go straight away, this means you can avoid it. When you lose a life you still have completed the blocks you did earlier.</td>
    <td>The controls are extremely difficult to understand and you can fall of the edge. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Atari centipede </td>
    <td>Points, lives.</td>
    <td>The centipede and all the parts that it becomes, the spider, you, the other hazards, the mushrooms </td>
    <td>The centipede sometimes turns towards you so you can shoot all of it at once. </td>
    <td>The centipedes are very fast which means you can’t really shoot them, you can’t aim after a certain point. The spider is very hard to shoot and often kills you at the start. It turns into smaller parts that you have to shoot separately.</td>
  </tr>
