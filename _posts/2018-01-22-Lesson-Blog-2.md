    <td>I learnt by persevering with my coding with Jaiman, writing everything out that was in the booklet, and throughout reading and typing the code we both tried to figure out what the different code did to our program. I found this strategy very effective as it will help me, when I get further in my coding, to know HOW I can do things with my code and not just that a certain block of code does a certain block of things. I also learnt from my own experience as I have dealt with strings and binary (1.3 and 1.4) before in different coding, on the SINCLAIR XZ81, I have also learnt how to do binary on my fingers and on paper- so again I believe I had an upper hand on Jaiman Lad again (although we did work well together as a team.</td>

    <td>The speed of my setting up of the FUSE box and of my typing is slowing down my work a bit but my main problem at the moment with IT, for me, will be that I need to work on my blog and as I have been told today about my blog, I need to make my background less confusing. So In mind of that, I will do this by making my background a bit darker, and I will code this by adding the code to make the background more transparent (around 0.7) and the code to make the colour behind the image black. I have decided to do this instead of changing my background because I love my background and the entire site (as you can see) has been modeled round it with the black and green colour scheme.  </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning next lesson by using the method I used today in this blog for typing (which is a lot quicker and means I can write a lot more in a shorter space of time) on the FUSE box, making Jaiman and I's work be done quicker and overall let us learn more. As Well as this I will work on my Blog and try to make it the best that it can be to show off all that I have learnt and all that I have done in IT. I will always try to make the Lesson Blogs Show what I did in the lesson as well as I learnt and how I learnt it as well as (like in this section) how I will improve myself and my attitude to learning to let myself learn more about IT, Coding and FUSE boxes.</td>
