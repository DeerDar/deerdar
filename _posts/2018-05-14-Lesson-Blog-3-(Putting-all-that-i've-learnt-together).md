  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by using all of the syntax and coding phrases that I have learnt so far in the course, and putting them all together to create code that does more and more complicated things. I also used my previous knowledge so that I could add to it using the def piece of syntax, that defines the string, and then return a different answer depending on what happens to the code, or what is written into the console. The strategy of referring back too old tasks when necessary and using skills that I learnt from those, and refreshing my memory of the syntax as well.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The speed of my working, limited how much learning that I could do, although slowing down at this point in time was inescapable due to the increasing difficulty of the coding tasks and the increasing number of pieces of syntax which I have to use in unison and connect together to do bigger and better things with my coding. I need to work on the habit of speed when it comes to reading the information about the tasks and the task at hand, speed will be very important here so that I can learn more whilst writing code, doing the thing that I'm practicing. I also need to work on my use of the hint bars, as I may overuse them, but they do help a lot when I am stuck, so I should probably use them more.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change how I approach questions, by reading the hint bar every time I get stuck and running the code multiple times to try and Identify all of the problems with the first code that I have written out. This will help and improve my learning by making me read more and able to understand what the different errors mean in terms of what I have actually written that is wrong, this will help in the future and mean that I can fix all the problems in my code a lot quicker and get on with learning the right syntax and generally how to code python.</td>
