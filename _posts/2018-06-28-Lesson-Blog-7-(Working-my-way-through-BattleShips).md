  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying to use all of the Syntax, both necessary and that I have learnt across the course of this course, as quickly as I can to perform the task that I am required to do. Battleships rewards this strategy as they use most of the known syntax in the tasks, meaning that if you try your best to incorporate useful programming skills that you have learnt during the course that are appropriate to the situation you will not go far from the answer.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My learning was limited by my understanding of the wording of the tasks at this point in BattleShips, as these new challenges on the course incorporate many different skills that were learnt at each different point in the course they are more complicated and therefore uses more complicated and confusing language, meaning that some tasks are quite hard to understand. I need to work on the habit of learning to understand more of the important coding language so I can complete tasks without having to try and decode sections of the text that displays the job that I have to do.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I shall try to remember more of the vocabulary as well as more of the syntax so that I can both complete the task well, and understand what the task actually is. This will improve mostly the speed of my learning as it shall mean that I don't have to spend vital minutes of my time coding trying to understand what Iâ€™m meant to be doing instead of actually getting on and doing my task and getting further through the course.</td>
