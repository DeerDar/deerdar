    <td>I learnt how to use strings and random generators to make games (guess the number between 1 and 100) and continued to use binary to draw space invaders using pixels, except this time Jaiman and I played around with the colour of the pixels and the size of the pixels to create and animation that constantly said, I  heart  Space Invaders. I found the strategy of practicing my typing speed outside of school in activities such as this, writing my blog and in other pieces of work that require typing and google drive in general. I have begun to see my speed increasing whilst I type, using more than one finger from each hand.</td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As Jaiman and I did less that we usually do in the book (FUSE book), we got through a lot less chapters that we have in recent lessons, this is either to do with the increase in complexity of these chapters since the beginning, when we completed three chapters in the first lesson, or we are getting slower. I think it is the first one of these two examples but they are both plausible. I need to work on telling my partner (Jaiman) what to write, code wise, like how I could describe a piece of text with speech on either side, a block of text that has to be CAPS or where a Space, Punctuation mark should go.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will change my skills in the field of dictation, I will try to work with Jaiman to establish a system that will be beneficial for me and my partner to help us work quicker and overall boost the performance of our coding skills as a team. I will improve my learning by, next time by going through the page in the FUSE book we're working on and reading more about how the code works, the origins of the code and where it is used in other known things that include code. I also need to keep aware when we are given the FUSE boxes, mouse, power cable and FUSE books, so I can get set up and going on with my code quicker.</td>
