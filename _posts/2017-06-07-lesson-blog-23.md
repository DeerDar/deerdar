    <td>I learnt by listening and reading about our identity map projects and gathering ideas in my head about how I would lay out my piece of work, this seems a very effective strategy as it lets you know how you're going to do your piece as it says in the guidance we have been given.   </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I must work on being able to write out what I plan to do for projects on a google doc as the notes that I took down after hearing and reading about the dos and don'ts of the identity map project. The first computer I went to didn’t work so that limited my learning as I wasn’t able to listen that well during that.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will work on making notes- in lesson, maybe using my notebook instead of a google doc. I will also improve my learning by writing during being told what to do instead of writing notes after we have been given instructions.</td>
