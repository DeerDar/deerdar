    <td>I learned by applying old knowledge to the things that I was learning during the lesson as I have used scratch before. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on remembering to copy the code when I need do so, as this greatly speeds up the process of coding and trying different things that are similar. </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will always duplicate my code when needs be and take notes so I can remember what to do or try later in the lesson. This will help and greatly speed up my work.</td>
