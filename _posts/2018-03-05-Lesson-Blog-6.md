  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by trying different patterns with the wires, the pattern that ended up working for me and Jaiman was changing the direction of the bulb. The instruction book told us to wire the bulb with the longer cable pointing up, and we did, but the code that I put in repeatedly didn't work with this setup. The change that me and Jaiman did was switching the two cables on the LED so that the longer wire was pointing in the opposite direction to our perception of up. The strategy of trying, trying and trying again (perseverance) was effective, especially because of how long it took to make any progress this lesson... </td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The inability for the breadboard to work for most of the lesson limited me and my partners learning and progress, we need to work on the habit of creativity when we think up new ideas to solve a problem like this, this would have made us resolve this issue before the end of the lesson, meaning more work would have been done. Also I need (still) to work on the skill of asking for help when I am in need of some. Throughout todayâ€™s lesson we needed a push in the right direction as we continuously thought the problem lied in the bulb being broken, however, we were wrong. </td>

    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will change the amount of work we are providing each lesson as these days we get through a lot less chapters than we used to. To be honest, the coding is getting harder, but we have been on 4-1 for two lessons now, only getting anything done at the end of today's lesson. I will improve my learning now in future lessons using what I learnt with the LED lights being placed the other way around. Drawing on this knowledge I will be able to do the wiring segment of my book in a shorter time span than how we are achieving now.  </td>
