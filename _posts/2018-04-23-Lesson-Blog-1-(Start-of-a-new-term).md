  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by reading the box on the left of the python coding box, called the learning box and trying to remember the (syntax) all of the important coding language that will help me later on in the course, and that I will use later in harder challenges. This strategy of reading the information provided will probably help me if I get stuck in the respective tasks, as well of this I believe that the strategy of continuously reading the tasks that the course gives you, because usually the answer is always something in the question! </td>

    <th>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>My knowledge, earlier, on floats limited my learning, as when I came across a question including them it slowed me down incredibly and stopped me from getting further on in this lesson, and therefore not being able to learn a lot more. I need to work on the habit of committing to memory all of the syntax, as all of the vocabulary I have found during this session of using codecademy will be very useful in the future when the tasks I am asked to perform become way, way harder.  </td>

  <tr>
    <th>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will change how I approach the questions on codecademy, making sure that I have read the entire information about the question before I proceed to answering it, this in and of itself will improve my learning, altogether and for the specific questions that I am reading up on. I also believe that doing this will help if I ever get stuck on any of the tricky questions, because the answers are always inside the explanation. I will also improve my learning by writing the blog after I have done more work on codecademy so that I can write about that work as well as the lessons work, and contemplate on that, being able to improve on my learning at home.  </td>
