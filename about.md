My Lesson "Over-Views" for each Computing lesson.

### More Information

Same template (table used) for each blog post. I will be using a FUSE BOX and coding it this year (year-eight) including learning how to make a grabber arm move and turn the FUSE BOXes lights turn on and off. I will try and keep my length of writing consistant in each post, writing as much as i can and thinking of every detail, about how i can improve and what i have been doing well in in IT. A blog post will appear here after every lesson (Monday) and report on my learning in that lesson.
